## Introduction

Europe has always been a favorite tourist destination for people around the world. With just one **Schengen Visa**, you can travel across 27 European countries without needing to apply for additional visas for each country.

However, the Schengen visa approval process is often considered difficult and intimidating due to high rejection rates. This article will thoroughly discuss tips and tricks to ensure your visa application gets approved.

## 1. Determine Your Main Destination

The first and most important rule in applying for a Schengen visa is: **You must apply to the embassy of the country that is your main destination.**

The main destination is determined by:
- The country where you will spend the most time/days.
- If the duration is the same for several countries, choose the first country you land in (First Port of Entry).

> If you spend 5 days in France and 3 days in the Netherlands, you must apply for a visa at the French application center (VFS/TLS).

## 2. Prepare a Healthy Bank Statement

Financial aspects are the number one reason for visa rejection. Immigration authorities want to ensure that:
1. You have enough money to fund your trip.
2. The money is legitimately yours (not an instant loan).

Make sure there are reasonable incoming and outgoing transactions in your account over the last 3 months. **Never deposit a large sum of money suddenly (lump sum) 1 week before printing your bank statement.**

## 3. Proof of Ties to Your Home Country

The embassy wants assurance that you will return to your home country and not become an illegal immigrant in Europe. The strongest proofs are:
- **Certificate of Employment** stating your position, salary, duration of employment, and approved leave.
- Proof of asset ownership (house/land certificate).
- Business Registration Certificate (if you are self-employed).

## 4. Use GetDocuFlight AI Visa Predictor
